# 2 - A Game About Everyone's Favourite Sorting System!

By 11BelowStudio

This game was made for a 'Trans Jam' on itch.io (https://itch.io/jam/trans-jam)

## How to play

Your job is to simply sort the blue circles into the blue area,
and the pink circles into the pink area.

There *definitely* won't be any circles that aren't pink or blue
(as *everyone* knows that it's *totally* impossible for things to not
fit into one of two rigidly defined categories),
and there's *definitely* 0 chance of the circles changing colour
or anything like that after you've sorted them.

After all, this system is *completely* flawless.

It's *totally* not the fault of the system when things refuse to conform to it.

* Java 8 or later

* An escape key (optional, but highly recommended)

    * Or just download the downloadable thing from the itch.io page
* Unzip the zipped folder somewhere
* Click on either '2.exe' or '2 - A Game About Everyone's Favourite Sorting System!.jar' to run it
    * They're identical tbh, except one's an .exe and one's just a .jar, depending on which one floats your boat I guess
* Don't mess around with the 'resources' folder pls
* yeah that's it.
