Once upon a time
some smartarse came up with a system
of assigning roles and expectations to people
based solely on how they looked at a first glance,
shoehorning them into one of two categories,
followed by peer pressuring them to conform.

This has made a lot of people very angry,
and has widely been regarded as a very bad move.

However, even though it's clearly unfit for purpose,
has many glaring flaws,
and does more harm than good,
some idiots still insist on using this system anyway...
