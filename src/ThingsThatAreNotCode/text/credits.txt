* DEVELOPER FOOTNOTE-Y THING *

There is quite a bit of stuff that
I want to say here, however,
I'm absolutely terrible with words,
so I have no idea how to say it.

Like, do you ever get that feeling of
wanting to say something,
but having no idea how to say it,
or how to go about starting to say it,
so you have no choice but to repress it?

That.

Hell, I've pretty much given up all hope
of being able to stop repressing it
at this point.

So yeah, apologies for the lack of any
sort of deep, insightful, commentary.

Not like that would be possible
anyway with this font and this music.

So, with that out of the way,
here's a TL;DR of what I'm attempting to say:

Trans rights.
Screw the gender binary.
Non-binary people are valid.
And if you disagree, you are an absolute idiot.



Anywho, hopefully this game wasn't too unbearable.
