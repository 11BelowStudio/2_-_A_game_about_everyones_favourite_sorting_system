* DEVELOPER FOOTNOTE-Y THING *

Hello!
As you haven't pressed space yet,
I'm assuming that you want to stick around for this.
And, if you get bored or something
you can just press space any time to go to the menu.

Couple of quick content warnings first:
Yes, there will be colourful language,
discussion about the subject of the game,
and I apologize in advance if it comes across as
a bit tone-deaf (I'm austistic,
so that sort of stuff is kinda hard for me)

Welp, with that out of the way, time to start!

So, I'll start by addressing the elephant in the room.

Yes, this game is about the gender binary system
and the act of assigning gender at birth,
and how fucking stupid that entire process is.

So, in case you are not aware about the problems,
imma just go over the basics of why the
gender binary is a complete pile of
steaming bullcrap.

* It asserts that sex = gender, when,
in reality, they are completely different.
tl;dr sex is physical, gender is mental.

* It fails to take the existence of
intersex people into account.
And, when this glaring issue arises,
the usual response tends to revolve
around blaming them for not neatly
fitting into these defined categories,
and then causing irreparable damage to them
by forcing them (physically and mentally)
to conform to the binary anyway.

* I've been looking around everywhere,
and I still can't find who the fuck asked
to be forced to conform to a certain identity
from the moment they were born,
without any choice in the matter.

* Hell, I find it hard enough to conform
to the expectations of neurotypical
society as-is, why the fuck am I also
forced to conform to other people's
poorly-concieved notions of gender
on top of that?

* And, if you think about it,
the gender binary stuff basically says
'You must constantly advertise to
everyone what genitals you have,
through your appearance,
your actions, and your thoughts.
There is no excuse for not
advertising what genitals you have'.

After all, it revolves around putting
people into one of two categories
based entirely on their genitals,
and then effectively shaping their lives
around what they have downstairs.

And that's honestly kinda fucked up.

Why the fuck should I be letting
everyone know what genitals I have?
And why should we expect others
to constantly inform us about what
they have downstairs?

And, if you're the sort of person who wants
to be able to instantly tell what genitals
people have (due to the gender binary
system forcing people to advertise this)
there's a name for people such as yourself:
Perverts.

So, if that does apply to you,
you are a danger to society,
and you need to stop being a perv.
